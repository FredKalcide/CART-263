## Dataset: Oscar Winners, Direction

>I wanted to picture a data set with data that was counter intuitive, that would leave ppl surprised that it wasn't as they thought.

>After looking, i found this dataset on Directorial oscar winners, and, given that black actors have won their respective oscar and black movies have won best picture in the past, i would have assumed that directors like Spike Lee or Ryan Coogler would have won in the past, but to my surprise, such is not the case.
>so, i set out to have points appears with light applause to express the lukewarm amount of black nominees over the years, and then draw comparison to the amount of white winners over the decades, while making the audience mistakenly think that many black directors have won in the past, when none have, actually.
